            <P class="para1">Hi. I am sheikh saadi form chandpur. Currently I am reading my honours at Daffodil
                International University in Information Technology and Management. But after completing my semester I
                understand that with my university study I would not do anything. That's the main reason I am doing this
                course.</P>

            <p class="para2">When i was in 2nd semester our web development course was introduced to us. But with ten thousand taka
                per course we didn't learn nothing. Then my nahid also said to me that web developer demand would be
                decreased day by day.So after a long time seeing jankar mahbub sir telling about web developer and
                decide to learn web development.</p>
